# Introduction

Hi Developers ðŸ‘‹. I am Kasra Hosseini - (K10) and I am a Developer. I have always been enthusiastic about Coding.

# About

I absolutely love my personal VS Code theme, which is also my official one! I have a passion for vibrant and energetic colors, and I find that using them helps me easily identify keywords and variables while coding. This theme is perfect for CSS, Python, JavaScript, PHP, JSON, jQuery, Node.js, React, Android, Swift, Angular, and more. If you enjoy colorful themes and have no trouble with them, this one is definitely the best choice for you.

# What is VS code Theme?

VS Code themes are pre-designed color schemes and styles that modify the appearance of your code editor's user interface, including the text editor, sidebar, status bar, and other elements.
